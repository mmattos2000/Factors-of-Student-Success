Dataset: [Student Performance Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance)

This project aims to investigate the factors that contribute to student success by analyzing data collected from students. Using logistic regression analysis, we explore how various factors such as age, absences, health, internet access, and extracurricular activities influence the likelihood of student success.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains information about students, including demographic variables and factors that may impact their academic performance. Each observation in the dataset represents a student, with a binary response indicating whether the student was successful or not.

## Analysis

The analysis focuses on identifying factors that may affect student success using logistic regression models. By examining the relationship between individual factors and the binary response variable representing student success, we aim to gain insights into which variables have the most significant impact on academic performance.

### Logistic Regression Analysis

- **Age:**
  - Investigates the relationship between student age and the likelihood of academic success.

- **Absences:**
  - Explores how the number of absences affects student success.

- **Health:**
  - Analyzes the impact of student health status on academic performance.

- **Internet Access:**
  - Examines whether internet access influences student success.

- **Extracurricular Activities:**
  - Investigates the relationship between participation in extracurricular activities and academic success.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have access to the dataset containing student data.
2. Execute the R code provided in this repository to perform logistic regression analysis and create plots.
3. Analyze the logistic regression results to understand the relationship between various factors and student success.
4. Use the insights obtained to develop strategies aimed at improving student outcomes and academic performance.
